  entryDescription: According to Christensen, she was in the back room making cupcakes
    when they broke in. After hearing glass shatter at around 8:50, she ran to the
    front of the store and saw four men dressed in all black. They made her open
    the register while they ate some pastries. She tried to delay them, but unfortanately
    they left before Gourdough arrived.
